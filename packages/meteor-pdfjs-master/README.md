## Contributing
Contributors are very welcome. There are many things you can help with,
including adding testing feature, creating examples for the examples folder...
Some guidelines below:

* **Questions**: It's okay to ask a question on Github Issues if you're
  having trouble since the volume is manageable. Just prefix your Github Issue with
  'Question: ' so we can differentiate easily. Also, please make sure you've read through
  pdf.js documentation and tried a few things before asking. This way you can be very
  specific in your question. Also, please provide a cloneable Github repository
  if the issue is complex. For more complex questions sometimes it's hard to get all of the context
  required to solve a problem by just looking at text.

* **New Features** & **Bugs**: You need to ask new features and bugs corrections to PDFjs creator
  on his GIT: http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/

* **Answer Questions!**: If you can help another user please do!

## TODO
1. Explain how to make a viewer with selectable text
